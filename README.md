# Deadlock-Detection


Operating System Project Documentation: DeadlockDetection
1. Introduction
Deadlocks occur when processes wait indefinitely for resources held by eachother, causing system stagnation. This project focuses on detecting andresolving deadlocks using Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) and Wait-For
Graph (WFG) methods. For example, if Process P1 holds Resource R1 andrequests R2, while Process P2 holds R2 and requests R1, a deadlock occurs. 2. Project Objectives
 Develop a tool to detect deadlocks in a multi-process system. Example: A banking system where multiple transactions compete for resources.  Implement algorithms to analyze resource allocation and process
dependencies. Example: Applying cycle detection to prevent ATM system failures.  Enhance system reliability by reducing deadlock risks. Example: Ensuring smooth execution of cloud computing tasks.  Provide strategies to resolve detected deadlocks. Example: Rolling back low-priority processes to free up resources. 3. Project Scope
Features and Functionalities
 Resource Allocation Graph (RAG):
Detects deadlocks using graph representation of processes and resources. Example: Visualizing dependencies in an airline reservation system.  Wait-For Graph (WFG):
Simplifies detection by considering only process dependencies. Example: Handling resource conflicts in database transactions.  Deadlock Detection Algorithms:
Uses cycle detection techniques (DFS) to identify deadlocks. Example: Finding cycles in a hospital management system.  Resolution Strategies:
Includes process termination, resource preemption, and rollback mechanisms. Example: Terminating non-essential processes in a web server to restore
function.  User Interaction:
Console-based input for easy system state definition. Example: Entering process details to simulate a deadlock scenario. Target Users
 Operating system developers and researchers. Example: Optimizing kernel-level resource management.  Students and professionals studying process synchronization. Example: Learning deadlock avoidance in academic projects.  Multi-processing and distributed computing environments. Example: Preventing deadlocks in cloud-based virtual machines. 4.

Core Algorithms and Logic :
Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)
 Represents processes and resources as a directed graph. Example: Modeling a printing queue system.  Uses adjacency matrix to track dependencies. Example: Managing hardware resource dependencies.  Applies Depth First Search (DFS) to detect cycles. Example: Identifying loops in a cloud-based server system. Wait-For Graph (WFG)
 Simplifies RAG by removing resource nodes. Example: Resolving conflicts in parallel computing.  Directs edges only between processes to check dependencies. Example: Managing process dependencies in a manufacturing unit.
 Detects cycles using DFS. Example: Identifying dependency loops in a ticket booking system. Modules
 Input Handling: Takes user input for process-resource allocation. Example: Entering process-resource mapping in a real-time OS.  Graph Construction: Builds dependency graphs. Example: Representing resource dependencies in an e-commerce platform.  Cycle Detection: Identifies deadlocks. Example: Detecting process blocks in a ride-sharing app.  Output Module: Displays results and possible resolution strategies. Example: Suggesting alternative resource allocations in a cloud service.

cout << "Deadlock Detected!" << endl;
return true;
}
}
return false;
